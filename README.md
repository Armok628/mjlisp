Amateur attempt at a LISP interpreter in pure C with no research

I am aware of the "Build Your Own Lisp" book, but I haven't read any part of it. I guess you'll just have to take my word for it, but if there's any similarity at all, it's purely by coincidence. At the time of this writing, I am an incoming college freshman intent on majoring in Computer Engineering.
